## Background

I am originally from Egypt, raised in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia. I currently live in Sharjah, UAE.

## Languages

- Arabic (native)
- English (fluent)

## Education

I have 3 degrees in 3 different fields from 3 different universities in 3 different countries with 3 different cultures.

- **Bachelor of Science** in Mechanical Engineering, Alfaisal University, Saudi Arabia. **2015**.
- **Master of Science** in Industrial and Systems Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea. **2017**.
- **Doctor of Philosophy** in Computer Science, University of New South Wales, Australia. **2021**.

My [PhD research](https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/entities/publication/d34622da-75cb-419f-b433-d9a452a2146a/full) was on developing new algorithms for accelerating topology optimization. All of my PhD research was implemented in an open source software package called [TopOpt.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTopOpt/TopOpt.jl).

## Work Experience

During my PhD, I worked as a part-time [Julia](https://julialang.org) programmer in the [Turing.jl project](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl). Currently, I am a senior product engineer and consultant at [PumasAI Inc.](https://pumas.ai). I am also a casual research affiliate at the University of Sydney Business School.
