# Software

All of the open source software projects I worked on can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mohamed82008). The following is a summary of my significant open source contributions categorized by field.

**I am not involved in some of these projects anymore** but I try to maintain many of the packages I started, although some may be neglected. If you are interested in any of the software I created and you think it is neglected, feel free to contact me and let me know! **You can always open an issue and ping me.**

If you are interested in doing a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) project in any of my projects especially in topology optimization or non-convex optimization, **I am open to mentoring**. So please reach out.

## Topology optimization

- I maintain the [JuliaTopOpt](https://github.com/JuliaTopOpt) organization
- [TopOpt.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTopOpt/TopOpt.jl) which is the main user-facing package of the JuliaTopOpt organization

## Optimization

- I maintain the [JuliaNonconvex](https://github.com/JuliaNonconvex) organization
- [Nonconvex.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNonconvex/Nonconvex.jl) which is the main user-facing package of the JuliaNonconvex organization
